# Implementations of different planning frameworks

The theory of this source code and it's used example is highly based on the following paper:

```Thomas Bolander: A Gentle Introduction to Epistemic Planning: The DEL Approach. M4M@ICLA 2017```

It's a learning project for an university course at the HTWK Leipzig and
might be a good starting point for others to dive into planning frameworks as well.
The code could be a lot cleaner at a lot places, including the tests.
But currently this is only for learning purposes.

## Planning frameworks

* Classical planning (100%)
* STRIPS planning (100%)
* Propositional planning (0%)
* Epistemic planning (0%)

Please feel free to submit pullrequests for theoretical errors and problems in my implementations
or even more frameworks (with multiple agents?)!
